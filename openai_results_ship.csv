4. **Pathway**: A clear, possibly paved pathway runs parallel to the shoreline, suitable for walking or cycling. This pathway helps in connecting the green space with other parts of the area.

5. **Row of Trees**: A neat row of trees, possibly ornamental, is planted along the pathway, providing shade and aesthetic appeal to the walkway.

6. **Buildings**: To the right of the green space and pathway, there are large buildings with red roofs, likely residential or possibly commercial. The architecture suggests they are designed to maximize views of the waterfront.

7. **Parking Lot**: Between the buildings and the green space, there is a gray area that appears to be a parking lot, indicating the area supports visitors or residents with vehicles.

8. **Smaller Structures**: Scattered around the buildings and parking lot, there are smaller structures, possibly sheds or utility buildings.

9. **Roads**: There are roads visible around the buildings, facilitating vehicle access to the buildings and possibly leading to other parts of the town or city.
