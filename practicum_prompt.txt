GA-CCRi would like Neal to investigate the use of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (LLMs) for the imporovment of convential object detection models. 

We expect Neal to leverage open source models and datasets to use and/or train models for both conventional detection and LLM detection. However, if this work incorporates sensative information, that will need to be redacted before the report is submitted. 

He will need to measure the performance of both types of models individually, which includes
	* standard metrics for convolutional object detections (P, R, F1)
	* New or existing metric for the LLM output, which may require natural language processing, clustering, or some other technique to identify true positives, false positives, false, negatives, true negatives. 
	
Additionally he will investigate ways to use LLM-generated captions to enhance the object detection metrics, either through explainability, improvement in overall performance, or robustness to adversarial attacks.
